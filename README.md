Deep learning homework for the GT Data Science Bootcamp!

## Report
After creating and tuning the nn model, here are my takeaways on the model's performance and the tuning process. 
### Overview
Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
### Results
* Data Preprocessing
  * target vars
  * feature vars
  * ![alt text](Isolated.png "Title")
  * removed vars
* compiling training and evaluating the model
  * how many neurons layers and activation functions and why?
  * achieved target model performance?
  * what steps did you take to increase model performance?
### Summary
Summarize overall results. Recommend a different model and explain your rec.
